# Connect4-C
The popular strategic game "Connect 4" made in C language. 

About the game:
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game played on a vertical board consisting of seven columns and six rows. The players take turns dropping colored discs into the columns, with the goal of connecting four of their own discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The game starts with an empty board, and the first player to get four of their colored discs in a row wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game is considered a tie.

Players must carefully consider each move to block their opponent's attempts to connect four discs while simultaneously trying to make their own connections. The game is easy to learn but offers strategic depth, making it an enjoyable experience for players of all ages and skill levels.

About the code:
The game is played in the terminal. Each player uses his turn to write the number of the column in which he wants to drop his piece. If it's a valid move, the other player will then have his turn. This continues until the game ends in a draw or a win.
